== Apache proxy

Some of devices don't support another port than 80 in their http request.
To test, a small proxy in Apache2 is required :

  RewriteRule     /(contacts.*) http://localhost:3000/$1 [P]
  ProxyRequests Off

  <Proxy http://localhost:3000/*>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
  </Proxy>
